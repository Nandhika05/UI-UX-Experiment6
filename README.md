## Result:

Generated multiple creative ideas for the hospital appointment booking app using Crazy 8s ideation. Created 8 quick sketches that showed different layouts for booking, reminders, and confirmation screens.

Wrote 5 user stories from the perspectives of patients, doctors, and hospital admins to clearly understand what each user needs and why.

Developed a scenario based on a real user, Riya, showing how she books an appointment under time pressure and feels relieved after completing the process quickly.

Created a flow diagram for the task of ordering food through an app, mapping each step from opening the app to order confirmation. This helped visualize the entire user journey.

Designed the information architecture for a university website using card sorting, organizing content into categories like Admissions, Academics, Departments, Events, and Student Services, and then building a clear site map.
